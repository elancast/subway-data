GOAL: Track how long it takes for subway to get from 86 to various stops and vice versa
Want to see times on average by time of day, weekend vs week day
Need to run script regularly to populate
Then need to graph

ALG:
  if 86th st and didn't see it previously in time,

want to be able to ID each train and track when it leaves where
interested in when train arrives at each station - which is the last scheduled time we see for a specific train
 -> interested in when train times disappear!

In that case:
- only care about top 3-5 trains
- when get new data:
  - compare with previous data
  - find "ID" per train based on distance from previous data
  - record if a train has left

to find ID:
- can assume trains will always be in order
- look at train leaving previous station


when found a train left:
- look at previous station to give it the same ID as the last train that left that
- if no previous station, assign new ID

to find train left:
- look at first train time
- grab previous time's data
- a train left if first train time is closer to prev[1] than prev[0]

store:
- raw train times:
  [ station ID, train time, iteration timestamp ]
- leaving times:
  [ station ID, train ID, train time, direction ]
- train IDs:
  [ train ID, direction ]
